# **Scripts**

###### In this ```README.md``` file,the workflow of each script will be mentioned breifly
 ```Install_Tensorflow.sh``` has to be excuted before ```Install_Keras.sh``` but ```install_JellyFish.sh``` may be excuted before both of them or after as it is independant so it is prefered to excute the scripts in the following order.

- ```Install_Ternsoflow.sh``` The first script to be excuted is this one, the content of this script is:                                Here tensorflow is installed with virtual environmentas the following     
  - first of all the virtual environment and PIP should be installed
  - Create the Virtual envionment where you will install the tensorflow,**"targetDirectory"** in the script has to be replaced     with directory name , here it is assumed to be **~/tensorflow**
  - activate the virtual environment to install the tensorflow
  - make sure that pip ≥8.1 is installed
  - install **tensorflow** in the created virtual environment
  - activate **tensorflow** and each time **tensorflow** will be used it will must be activated.
  - to make sure that tensorflow is activated import tensorflow
  
- ```Install_Keras.sh``` The Secound one is this script as keras used the tensorflow as backend, The content of the script
  - virtual environment has to be created to install keras in it
  - work on the created virtual environment
  - install some python dependencies
  - install keras
  - if keras.hson is not exist in the /keras/keras.json Keras has to be imported 
  - import keras to make sure it is successfully installed.
  
- ```install_JellyFish.sh```  this script to install jellyfish 
      just issuing the 2 lines which will install it directly
      
- ```Count_Kmers.sh``` this script for using the jellyfish to count kmers and get the frequencies so it must be excuted in the same order
  - divide the fasta dataset file into k-mers **reads.fasta** shoud be replaced with the name of the datasetfile
  - get the histogram of k-mers frequencies and write the output to file **OutputFile** may be replaced with any file name
  - it is optional and may be commented by **;** or **#**, it is only for search on specific k-mer to make sure that the returned    k-mers is correct

- ``` 	Filter_Kmer_Histogram.py```  this script to filter the k-mers and neglect the k-mers with 1 frequency
  - open the file of k-mers histogram, **your_Kmers_HistogramFile** should be replaced with the name of the histogram file.
  - read lines of the file and put it in list
  - traverse on the list and split each line into 2 strings the first for the kmer and the second for the frequency and select the lines with frequency more than one.
  - open another file to write the result in it, **yourOutputFile.txt** should be created in the same of the histogram file and replaced with any name.
  
- ```ConvertToFasta.py``` this script for converting the data set file to fasta files.
  - reading all the zipped files in the folder
  - unzipped them
  - adding headers to the files
  - change the extension to .fasta
  
- ```CatchKmerCounts.sh``` this script for catching the kmers with frequencies.
  - read each .fasta file in the folder
  - apply jelly fish to get the kmers
  - write the kmers with the frequencies
  
- ```repeatKmers.py``` this script to get file with all kmers repeated with it's frequency 
  - read each .fa file
  - store the frequency of the first line
  - repeat the kmer in the followed line by the stored frequency
  - save the new file with the original one name followed by 1
  
- ```MergeNormaData.py``` this script for merge all the normal data files into one file with lable 0

- ```MergeTumerData.py``` this script for merge all the Tumer data files into one file with lable 1
